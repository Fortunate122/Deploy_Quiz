# Coding Quiz

## Description
Coding Quiz is a full-stack, timed quiz application that challenges users with multiple-choice questions on programming topics. Built with React, TypeScript, Vite, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, it features a clean UI, a countdown timer, persistent scores, and structured question data. The project uses Cypress for testing and is deployed to Render with an automated CI/CD pipeline.

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was to build a dynamic, interactive quiz app from scratch using modern full-stack technologies. I aimed to practice component-based UI development with React, REST API integration with Express, and efficient CI/CD deployment using GitHub Actions and Render.

## Usage
This quiz app presents users with timed questions stored in a MongoDB database. It demonstrates:
- Component-based UI with React and Vite
- MongoDB integration with Mongoose
- RESTful API structure
- Real-time validation and timer mechanics
- Cypress-based component test automation
- CI/CD via GitHub Actions (test on PR to `develop`, deploy on push to `main`)

## License
This project is licensed under the None license.

## Learning
I learned how to configure GitHub Actions for testing and deployment, structure a full-stack app for Render compatibility, and automate database seeding with JSON inputs. This project also improved my understanding of TypeScript, Vite, and Cypress.

## Standout
What makes this project stand out is:
- A complete CI/CD pipeline: test + deploy
- Structured backend with seed automation
- Responsive, interactive UI
- Real-world questions loaded from `.json` files
- Modular and scalable architecture
